# My Customization

This README is for [my own customization](https://github.com/samwize/oh-my-zsh). Do read the [original oh-my-zsh README](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) too.

- `/templates/zshrc.zsh-template` includes my own custom defaults
- `custom` is no longer gitignore, and has my own `custom.plugin.zsh`
